# Explanation:
When people are sharing their screen on Discord, Zoom, or even on sites like Twitch.tv. They often use their browser to react to videos, present information, play a game, etc. And if they visit a page that displays their full name, email, or some other type of personal information, that information is visible to the stream and there is nothing they can do to stop it. That information can then be used to spam, dox, and harrass a streamer or a user of these platforms. Platforms like Discord have a built in 'Streamer Mode' that hides personal information on Discord. But these modes don't protect users when they are streaming their browser. Other sites or platforms could still display personal information and up until recently there was no tool to protect users. This extension is the tool that solves these problems. With it, you can prevent your information from getting in the hands of people that shouldn't have ever had it; by preemptively removing that information from pages, before those pages are even visible.

## Upcoming Updates:
- Add a counter to the extension icon in the toolbar, showing how much personal information was removed.
- Ability to choose different ways to handle the PII: spoiler like in Discord, replace the text with a word, remove it all together, or specify a word to replace it with (https://github.com/AidanSpeakss/streamer-mode-for-firefox/issues/7)
- Implement feature to add randomly generated PII to user settings, to make determining which PII is accurate to the user very difficult.
- Find and implement workaround to hide tab title during load.
- External site for unsupported URL's and module to check site every 24 hours for new unsupported URL's and store them in browser storage
- Button to toggle tool on/off
- Experimental feature to hide the window from capture software (being worked on by: https://github.com/ConniBug)
